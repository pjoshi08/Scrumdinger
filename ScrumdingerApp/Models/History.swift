/// The array of DailyScrum items in ScrumdingerApp is the source of truth for the appâ€™s data. ScrumsView has a binding to the array, and it passes a binding to an individual item in the array to DetailView. The detail view passes the binding to MeetingView. Bindings keep your model data in sync with a single source of truth, so all your views reflect the same data.
